    <h1>Reserved this page in the event that tumblr's usual beutiful dumpsterfire actually burns it to the ground this time</h1>
    <p>There is nothing here for now but soon enough there may be more, writings, poetry research, programming, art and more :3</p>
    <p>In the meantime you can find me at @yourspineislookingsharp</p>
    <p>Maybe once there is some actual content on here I'll have some site mirrors on more decentralised hosting networks :3</p>

    <h1> About </h1>
    <p>I am a wolf (sometimes) that named itself raven, I write and produce a podcast whose main character shares my chosen name and vibes, if that becomes confusing you can also call me moth >w< more info to come </p>
    <!-- <h1>Basic pronoun sheet</h1> -->
    <h3>here is a sheet containing some example pronouns and how I feel about them </h3>
     <p>(for myself, obviously if I say I don't vibe with one that doesn't mean I don' like people who use it, it just doesn't work so well when refering to me), most of the time I'm Comfortable with any! Oh and, these may change over time I'm an indescisive little thing</p>
