    <h1>On nostalgia, lost opportunities and false hope; a retrospective on the site that was Tumblr</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Though my history with tumblr is strange and in some ways quite long, I only really joined the site in late 2022. </p>
    <p> I had been drawn in by the screenshots of half-decade old in-jokes and art, reposted  without consultation onto the only social media I had been allowed at the time (Pintrest).</p>
    <p>From my younger days in the wilds that were the early 2010's I had yearned for the kind of community that it seemed to provide, the hope for those strange and nerdy and, though I had not known at the time, queer.</p>
    <p>People like me were few and far between in the halls of repression carved by the deeply catholic environment in which I was raised. Fun right, anyway, at the time tumblr seemed like this great safehaven of nostalgic fun, but like a lot of things I eventually had to grow the fuck up and realise that the world if full of shit.</p>
    <p>And amazingly it was amoung the growing harrasment campeigns by the dear fuckhead CEO, that the long simmering realisations I had tried my best to hold at bey, because I though I had better things to deal with, began to boil over. </p>
    <p>You see, what I could never have guessed, despite being a walking clich√© and not having a single cishet friend, was that I was not exactly the boy I had though I was. To be honest blahaj should have told me when I bought them.</p>
    <p>All of this is to say, Tumblr's historic crash and burn happened during a time I myself was only just realissing how I too should have been aflame, and I was poised to leave perfectly. Supposedly I had no investment having only just joing, so why did I hold out so long, why did I stay?</p>
